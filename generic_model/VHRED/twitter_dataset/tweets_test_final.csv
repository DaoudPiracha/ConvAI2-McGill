Last i checked he wasn't in the top of ANY major stat category......,@MV3_2011 yet avg similar pts reb ast/gm as LeBron,@MrSwaggahimself u've raised no good argument on justifying why rose is the mvp leader.I'm starting 2 think ur just saying what u hear on tv,@MV3_2011 62-20. That's all that matters. Who supposed to win it?,"@MrSwaggahimself wait, r u saying that a team's record is all that matters in the mvp race?",@MV3_2011 my only other option is Durant. He's sick.,"@MrSwaggahimself and I disagree with lebron not being consistent, i've watched every game and if what i witnessed wasnt consistency...",@MV3_2011 the entire Heat team came out sluggish. LeBron included.,"@MrSwaggahimself the TEAM's first 15 games weren't pretty, but lebron still got his #'s",@MV3_2011 the fact that he's surrounded by Bosh and Wade (and Bosh isn't that GREAT) its easier for LeBron.,@MrSwaggahimself this rose 4 mvp things taken a life of its own with more n more jumpin on the bandwagon without checkin it out 4 themselves,@MV3_2011 I'm a Bulls fan so I see his importance just like you taking LeBron for Miami. And I like LeBron but Rose had more of an impact.,@MrSwaggahimself That stat proves that lebron has more of an impact than rose on his team,@MV3_2011 Bulls never lost more than 2 games in a row. Meaning more effective. This years MVP is DERRICK ROSE. 62-20. #1 in the League.

For the scottish election Labour need to sell a better vision not just emphasising that we'd be better at governing.let yer passion out iain,@Altany Plenty perspiration and hopefully enough inspiration over the next 2 months. Eck being so smug all the time is infuriating though,@gordon_mack unfortunately he seems to get off rather lightly in the parochial media. Iain needs a sustained attack on manifesto fails.,"@Altany I agree, the 100 tweets of broken promises was effective but I would say that as I was following the account. Needs a wider audience",@gordon_mack having decent ammo to fire and consistently firing it will have an impact. this is a doorstep election. stick to main points!,@Altany There's certainly ground to take here. SNP Council cutting education by £4mil yet saying kids would get better education for example,@gordon_mack they have managed the populist easy hits but achieved eff all.

What do you want? You're my guest.",@Ikutia Y: C-can you get me some soup?,@Pelor1 *Ikutia smiles and starts leaving* Of course. *Yuki's mind* Mu: C-could you tell Murakumo that Mu is sorry?,@Ikutia Y: W-wait Ikutia. Can I talk to Murakumo real quick?,@Pelor1 *Murakumo takes over* M: Yes?,@Ikutia Y: Mu wanted me to tell you that she is sorry.,@Pelor1 *Yuki's mind* Mu: Mu is sorry what she did to everyone. Mu needs Murakumo to forgive her. *Murakumo stands shocked*,@Ikutia Y: She says that she is sorry for what she did to everyone and that she needs you to forgive her.,"@Pelor1 *Murakumo stares, then nods* M: Apology accepted.",@Ikutia Y: He accepts your apology Mu.,@Pelor1 *Mu lights up and begins bouncing around* Mu: Yay! The master unit looks kindly on Mu!,@Ikutia *Yuki laughs* Y: Yes he does. But with someone as kind as you it is hard not to.,@Pelor1 Mu: Master unit never trusted Mu. Thought Mu was too unstable. Mu sees now that master unit was right.,@Ikutia Y: Well you are better now Mu. He trusts you now. And I do too.,@Pelor1 Mu: Yuki is Mu's first friend. Little girl was never Mu's friend.
