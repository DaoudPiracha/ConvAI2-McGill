Youth unemployment increased 40% under the last govt (during economic boom!). How can people say the min wage naysayers were wrong?,"@DanConservative A lot of that, mind, was due to skills shortage & attitude amongst (British) youth to work",@Rayne360 and employers didn't flee en masse to China because of an attitude change either!,"@DanConservative The fact employers fled to a country with low human rights & slave wages speaks volumes about them, not Britain or min wage",@Rayne360 so what you're saying is poverty + unemployment here is fine as long as our laws say nice things about workers?,"@DanConservative I'm saying our benefits system literally pays our youth to stay home. This is slowly getting sorted, tho",@Rayne360 I agree with you there but it's only half of the problem. Young people should be allowed an opt out of min wage to get experience.
